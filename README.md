<p>So the last 2 weeks have been super chaotic. I wanted to start with the portfolio a bit earlier. 
But now I am in Budapest still with no real plan, what is my scheduele or how I am going to work:))
Anyway since nothing is super sure at the moment I thought of just starting the app. 
I have made the decision of focusing on learning Swift and how to build Apps in IOS in general, because I kinda hate Windows very much
So have fun following my progress or something </p>
